A website to measure your typing speed and accuracy along with the time elapsed

Beginning 2021 on a simple note I have developed a simple project which measures the typing speed of an induvidual given an input paragraph. 

## How to play the game?

To play the game you initially will be given with two boxes, the first box where the paragraph is displayed and in the second one you need to type the above paragraph. Be sure to make the paragraph you type error free as there are penalties given for error. Click the start button to get a randomly generated paragraph and the result button to obtain the results. 

Hope you enjoy the game! 
Thank you.
